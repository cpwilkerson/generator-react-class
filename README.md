> Creates a react class js file, a test js file, and a sass file.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-react-class using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-react-class
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo react-class
```

## Running your project

You will need to install gulpjs, and nodemon globally.
```bash
npm install -g gulp
npm install -g nodemon
```

Running in development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

# NODEMON Known Issue

In the generated node app, there is a problem in the ```npm run dev``` script
that currently requires you to run ```npm run dev``` twice.
